Jabber

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to approach a new set of skills that we would self teach and use. We developed using Google's FireBase and the required queries to store both user data and blob media files. We implemented several components of the Google Maps API.  

About the Site
Jabber was inspired by the lack of audio based social medias. We wanted to create a platform that's base concept was able to compete with today's best. The goal was to create a place to leave pinned voice clips in the form of either a locational review or an entertaining story.  

Technologies Used
For our technologies, we planned on using React, Express, and Node.js. However, we also wanted to push ourselves into new territory with this project. We understood the user experience should be sleek and uninterrupted. We chose SASS for writing out the UX, allowing us to keep of files readable and concise for ourselves and our team. Building forward, we needed a way to store user media files. FireBase seemed to be an appropiate coupling due to the fact we'd be needing the Google Maps API later on. Initially implementing for the sole purpose of blob storage, we made an unaminous decision to further utilize FireBase for it's FireStore database. As well as user authentication.
